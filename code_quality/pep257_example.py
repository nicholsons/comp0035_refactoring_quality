"""Demonstrate high quality docstrings.
Module-level docstrings appear as the first "statement" in a module. Remember,
that while strings are regular Python statements, comments are not, so an
inline comment may precede the module-level docstring.
After importing a module, you can access this special string object through the
``__doc__`` attribute; yes, it's actually available as a runtime attribute,
despite not being given an explicit name! The ``__doc__`` attribute is also
what is rendered when you call ``help()`` on a module, or really any other
object in Python.
You can also document a package using the module-level docstring in the
package's ``__init__.py`` file.

def main():
    """Illustrate function-level docstring.
    Note that all docstrings begin with a one-line summary. The summary is
    written in the imperative mood ("do", "use", "find", "return", "render",
    etc) and ends with a period. The method signature is not, in any way,
    duplicated into the comments (that would be difficult to maintain).
    All subsequent paragraphs in a docstring are indented exactly the same as
    the summary line. The same applies to the closing quotation marks.

    Classes use a special whitespace convention: the opening and closing quotes
    are preceded and followed by a blank line, respectively. No other
    docstrings should be preceded or followed by anything but code.
    A blank line at the end of a multi-line docstring before the closing
    quotation marks simply makes it easier for tooling to auto-format
    paragraphs (wrapping them at 79 characters, per PEP8), without the closing
    quotation marks interfering. For example, in Vim, you can use `gqip` to
    "apply text formatting inside the paragraph." In Emacs, the equivalent
    would be the `fill-paragraph` command. While it's not required, the
    presence of a blank line is quite common and much appreciated. Regardless,
    the closing quotation marks should certainly be on a line by themselves.

        '''triple single quotes.''' This is a convention for consistency and
        readability. However, there are two edge cases worth knowing about
